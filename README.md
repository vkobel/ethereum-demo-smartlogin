# SmartLogin √êAPP
This repo contains the code of a full Ethereum "web3" application. 

## Notes
This application exists for educational purposes only, it is no way made to be used on production systems (though it should be secure, if using an external node and not the browser support).

The web-ui supports 2 modes: full wallet support in a browser (works for mobile clients) and an external provider such as Mist, MetaMask or even a local geth/parity node.

The in-browser support asks for a seed in order to derive its private key and corresponding address. Since any seed is accepted this should be used as a demostration only, the address generated by this **SHOULD NOT BE USED** on the main network.

The contract address present in web-ui/index.html file is the contract's address on the Rinkeby testnet, feel free to use this one or create your own.

## Structure
The **SmartLogin** folder is a [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) project containing both the SmartLogin Ethereum contract written in solidity and the nodejs server application that processes the transactions and executes the corresonding command locally.

The **web-ui** folder is a pure HTML/CSS/JS application using [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) and some [ethereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs) libs: ethereumjs-wallet to handle a simple in-browser wallet and ethereumjs-tx to sign transactions in the browser.
